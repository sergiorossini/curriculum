# Sergio Rossini

## :dart: Introduction

Hey there! I am Sergio Rossini, a proud Brazilian with 16 years of success stories as a technology professional. My
graduation in Computer Science was taken at [UFJF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Juiz_de_Fora) and I have courses and boot camps related to DevOps, Cloud, Leadership
and English. This knowledge allowed me to build my career acting as Developer, Scrum Master and Software Architect
within Brazilian and international projects.

I am originally from [Juiz de Fora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juiz_de_Fora), but I live in [Belo Horizonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte), MG, Brazil. <br>

**Maven**, **Redis**, and **rabbitMQ**, all supported by the **Facade design pattern** with **CI CD by Azure pipelines**, deployment of
components by **ArgoCD** and monitoring by **New Relic**. As a Senior, I worked on new features, bug fixing, technical
refinement, and team support including leadership, code review, production, failure investigation, monitoring, and load
tests.

* Previous experiences as Developer include older versions of **Java**, **Hibernate**, **Oracle** with **Functions** and **Stored Procedures (PL SQL)**, **WebSphere Server** and **JBoss Seam**. Also, **SOA integration** with **EJBs** exposed by web

and **PostgreSQL**.

* During short periods, I also had an opportunity to work with Azure, when I learned more about **Kubernetes**, **Helm
Charts**,

* Quality is a natural concern and because of it, I am always in touch with the QA to implement unit and integration tests
using **JUnit5** and **Mockito**; component tests with **docker containers**, **Robot**, **Newman**, **Wiremock** and **Postman**. For load tests, I
used **Gatling** and **Scala**.

migration** with **NestJS**,
**NodeJS** microservices and **MongoDB**.
* This project also used **CI CD by Azure pipelines** and deployment of
components by
**ArgoCD**. The tool for monitoring was **DataDog**.
* I led an international team with developers from Brazil, Portugal
and Nigeria. Our challenges were accomplished with success.

#### Scrum Master

* After being successful with my performance as a Developer, CI&T gave the challenge to work as a Scrum Master. I had
opportunity to lead great teams boosting the business of Brazilian and USA customers. I developed a strong experience
leading teams in an international context.
